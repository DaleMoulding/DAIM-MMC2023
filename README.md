# DAIM @ MMC2023

## Overview

Representatives from [DAIM](https://www.rms.org.uk/community/science-sections/image-analysis.html) will be delivering an introduction to image analysis workshop in the Learning Zone @ [MMC 2023](https://www.mmc-series.org.uk/) from 12:30 - 14:00 on July 4th. We'll commence with a brief introduction to the topic of image analysis and why it's necessary to ensure reproducible results are derived from microscopy data. We'll then split into parallel demonstrations to show how you can get started performing simple tasks like counting objects using three popular platforms for image analysis: [FIJI](https://fiji.sc/), [napari](https://napari.org/) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

            <td colspan=3>You design your experiment, prepare your samples, acquire your images on a microscope and then transfer all your data to some storage device - now what? How do you go about converting all those images into a graph that succinctly communicates the result of your experiment? In this talk, you will learn why manual inspection of your images (even with the use of "analysis" software) is generally a bad idea - aside from being tedious and time-consuming (and often impractical for very large data sets), it introduces (unconscious) bias into your analysis. You will learn what image analysis is, what it can (and, more importantly, what it cannot) do and how you can go about taking advantage of it (spoiler alert: it's easier to get started than you think).</td>
